# Getting-Ready-for-Physics-Class
Python Functions Review

You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

Task #1
Create a function: f_to_c that takes two inputs
f_temp - takes the temperature in Fahrenheit
c_temp - takes the temperature in Celsius
return c_temp

Task #2
Test the function(f_to_c) with a value of 100
Define a variable f100_in_celsius and set it equal to the function

Task #3
Create a function: c_to_f that takes two inputs
return f_temp

Task #4
Test the function(c_to_f) with a value of 0
Define a variable c0_in_fahrenheit and set it equal to the function

Task #5
Create a function: get_force that takes two inputs
mass
acceleration

Task #6
Test get_force with the global variables train_mass and train_acceleration
Save the result to the variable train_force

Task #7
Print the string "The GE train supplies X Newtons of force.”, with X replaced by train_force.

Task #8
Create a function: get_energy that takes in mass and c
c is a constant with a default value 3*10**8
get_energy should return mass multiplied by c squared

Task #9
Test get_energy by using the global variable bomb_energy and the variable c

Task #10
Print the string “A 1kg bomb supplies X Joules.”, with X replaced by bomb_energy.

Task #11
Create a function: get_work that takes in mass, acceleration, and distance
Work is defined as force multiplied by the distance
Get the variable force using the get_force, then multiply that by the distance
Return the result

Task #12
Test get_work by using the variables: train_mass,train_acceleration,train_distance
Save the variable train_work

Task #13
Print the string "The GE train does X Joules of work over Y meters.", with X replaced with train_work and Y replaced with train_distance.
